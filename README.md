# Git - Github Reference

## Downloading git

You [can find git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). To make your life easier, you may want to also [download a gui](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis).

## Learning git

The ["official" website is a great resource.](https://git-scm.com/doc) However, if you really want to learn (and have 15 minutes of spare time), [play with this](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1). It's free. :-)

Also, [great cheat-sheet](https://training.github.com/kit/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf).

# Using git

To use git from **Matlab**, first install git from the links above. Then, download
[this](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/38600-git-matlab)
and add it to matlab's path. 


You can also use [git from within RStudio](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN) and from most text editors. Some shells (bash, zsh, fish, etc.) also have the option of showing you the status
of a git repo in the command line. 

And you can try to use a [porcelain](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) of git, like [gitless](http://gitless.com/).
